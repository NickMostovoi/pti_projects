<h3>London, England</h3>
<div class="Container">
    <dl>
        <dt>London is the place to be</dt>
        <dd class="textForImg"> This is a cultural leader, a creative powerhouse, and a trend-setter, thriving on
            diversity as one of the most <b> iconoclastic cities in the world </b> . Market shopping and the street
            scene take precedent in London even though the city’s museums house some of the most important art
            collections in the world. London holds its history close but also continually renews itself with subcultures, which makes it
            incredibly interesting. <br>
            What other destination has such high prices and cringe-worthy weather <sub>yet draws</sub> visitors back
            time and time again? The pub scene was practically born in <i> London </i> , and with such varied residents from all around the world, it’s
            also one of the most interesting scenes today. All the music, fashion, and design coming out of London hit
            the international stage, making waves all over the world.

<h3>Hamburg, Germany</h3>
<div class="Container">
    <img src="../img/Hamburg%20800x450.jpg" alt="hamburg">
    <dl>
        <dt>Hamburg <sup>might</sup> not be an obvious choice</dt>
        <dd class="textForImg break_word">
            One of the world’s most exciting cities but upon closer inspection, it
            definitely fits the bill. As the largest port and <em> second biggest city in the country </em> , the thriving commercial center
            is refreshingly bold as much can be said about almost every scene in Hamburg, from art to food and especially the nightlife. The maritime spirit can be felt throughout Hamburg from squawking gulls to restaurant menus to
            architecture. Multiculturalism is exemplified through diverse neighborhoods and cuisine. Boho-chic Schanzenviertel
            and Grossneumarkt Square offer epic nightlife entertainment with waterfront venues pumping out the best of
            electronic and live music.

<h3>Barcelona, Spain</h3>
<div class="Container">
    <dl>
        <dt>Everything about Barcelona</dt>
        <dd class="textForImg break-all">
            Is captivating, from its history and architecture to its cuisine and natural
            attractions. Gaudi’s masterpieces are magnificent, but the art <i> scene goes far beyond </i> them with artisans throughout the
            lively El Born district, Consell de Cent’s uptown galleries, and exhibitions throughout Eixample. Bohemian, carefree, and
            trendsetting, Barcelona’s diverse restaurants run the gamut from fashionable tapas bars to hole-in-the-wall food stalls and the bar scene is just as eclectic. Start in Las Ramblas and good luck keeping up with the locals as they drink their way around the city. <strong> Wander the Gothic Quarter for hip </strong> and almost-hidden hotspots, get a taste of
            sophistication in trendy El Born, take in the edgier scene in Raval, or imbibe in the trendy barrio Poble Sec. And
            you’ve never witnessed a group so rowdy as when the city’s football team has a match at home, so plan to see a
            Barcelona FC game if you’re in the area!
